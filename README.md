Android Mobile Game - Food Does Not Strike

This is a mobile game developed using Android Studio IDE. I am going to state below how to compile and excute this game.
1. Unzip the file 'FoodDoesNotStrike.zip'.
2. Launch Android Studio on your system.
3. Click 'Open an Existing Project' and select the unziped project folder. Or simply drag the project folder to the window.
4. To compile the application, go to 'Build' -> 'Make Project'. Android Studio will build your application and display any errors or warnings in the Build output window.
5. You can choose to run the application on an emulator or a physical device. To run the application on an Android emulator, click the green 'Run' button in the toolbar. To run the application on your own device, you can simply use a USB cable to connect your computer to your physical device. Or you can go to  'Build' -> 'Build Bundle(s)/APK(s)' -> 'Build APK(s)' to generate an apk of the application.
